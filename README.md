# 🍻 DrunkDiary

DrunkDiary is a Letterboxd-style social diary for drinks —  
a place to log what you drank, who you drank with, and the memories attached to it.

## Why DrunkDiary?
People remember moments, not bottles.
DrunkDiary helps you capture both.

## Core Features (MVP)
- Global alcohol database
- Personal drink logs with ratings & notes
- Timeline of memories
- Digital shelf of bottles you've tried
- Friend tagging (auto-created logs)

## Tech Stack
- Flutter
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)

## Current Status
🚧 MVP in development (Week 1)

## Vision
Build a meaningful, memory-first drinking journal — not a recommendation engine.
